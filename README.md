# Game-Physics
The basic goal of this project is to balance a two joint leg.
Advanced goals include, but not limited to:
- Extra limbs that also move to maintain balance (e.g. under windy conditions)
- Soft bodies that passively react to the motion (e.g tails, hairs or clothes)
- Pose dependent joint limits
